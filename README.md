# Python Cryptography Playground
This project is being built to help me learn how cryptography works.

**KeyExchange:**
This file takes a look at the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. 
This is useful for two parties to establish a symetric key. 

**RSA:**
This file generates a private key and public key for use in RSA encryption.
It also shows how data can be encrypted with the public key or signed with the private key.
